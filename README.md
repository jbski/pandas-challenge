# pandas-challenge
This Pandas analysis will analyze the district-wide standardized test results. Source files include student and school data, which reports studen's math and reading scores and other information.  

The data in this file has been aggregated to show obvious trends in school performance.

Some relevant categories include:

    1) District Summary
    2) School Summary
    3) Top Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
    4) Bottom Performing Schools (By % Overall Passing)
    5) Math Scores by Grade
    6) Reading Scores by Grade
    7) Scores by School Spending
    8) Scores by School Size
    9) Scores by School Type

### Observable Trends:
1) Charter schools perform better than the district schools

2) Spending per student is not linked to better test scores. The best scores are actually in the lowest spending category.
